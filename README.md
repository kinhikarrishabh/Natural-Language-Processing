This Repository contains the fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing executed in parts. 

# Small Description of each file is given below : - 
1) *NLP Basic Text Pre Processing* : It explores the most common and important pre-proccessing steps to be taken while dealing with Text Based Dataset. Eg. Stop word Removal, Lowercasing, Punctuation Removal, Word/Sentence Tokenization, Lemmatization and Stemming, just to mention a few.
   
2) *File Handling* : Often times, while we'll be dealing with NLP Based Projects, the dataset would be in the form of different file formats, and we learn to handle different file formats with the use of Python. We explore the Regex Module of Python to see how it can benefit to aid our tasks.

3) *Feature Engineering in NLP* : Obtain most frequent words distribution, average chapter length, most frequent phrases (bi, tri and quadgrams), names of characters, places, and events for any two books/novel, interpret findings through word-clouds, bar plots and histograms and perform EDA on some available textual dataset.

4) *Vector Space Models* : Implementation of Word2Vec word embedding technique to observe similarity between two words/sentences and Implementation of GloVe word embedding technique to measure semantic similarity.

5) *Information Extraction-POS tagging and NER* : Identify Part of Speech such as Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb and tag it. Identify named entity in the text for Named Entity Recognition.

6) *Sentiment Analysis* : Select a dataset, perform Exploratory Data Analysis, text preprocessing, feature engineering. Implement sentiment analysis on the given dataset in Natural Language Processing and then analyze and comprehend the results obtained.
