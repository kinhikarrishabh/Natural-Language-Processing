This Repository contains the fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing executed in parts. Small Description of each file is given below 
1) *NLP Basic Text Pre Processing* : It explores the most common and important pre-proccessing steps to be taken while dealing with Text Based Dataset. Eg. Stop word Removal, Lowercasing, Punctuation Removal, Word/Sentence Tokenization, Lemmatization and Stemming, just to mention a few.
   
2) *File Handling* : Often times, while we'll be dealing with NLP Based Projects, the dataset would be in the form of different file formats, and we learn to handle different file formats with the use of Python. We explore the Regex Module of Python to see how it can benefit to aid our tasks.
