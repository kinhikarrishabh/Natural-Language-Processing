    "para = \"The benefits of exercise. Regular exercise offers numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. Engaging in physical activity can improve cardiovascular health, boost energy levels, and help maintain a healthy weight. It also reduces the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.Exercise isn't just about physical health, though. It has a profound impact on mental well-being as well. When you work out, your body releases endorphins, which are natural mood lifters. This can reduce feelings of stress and anxiety while promoting a sense of overall happiness. In conclusion, incorporating regular exercise into your daily routine is a simple yet effective way to enhance your physical and mental health. So, whether it's going for a jog, hitting the gym, or even just taking a brisk walk, find an activity you enjoy and make it a part of your life.\"\n",
